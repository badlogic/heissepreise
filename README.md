# Heisse Preise

A terrible grocery price search "app". Fetches data from big Austrian grocery chains daily and lets you search them. See <https://heisse-preise.io>.

You can also get the [raw data](https://heisse-preise.io/api/index). The raw data is returned as a JSON array of items. An item has the following fields:

-   `store`: (`billa`, `spar`, `hofer`, `dm`, `lidl`, `mpreis`)
-   `name`: the product name.
-   `price`: the current price in â‚¬.
-   `priceHistory`: an array of `{ date: "yyyy-mm-dd", price: number }` objects, sorted in descending order of date.
-   `unit`: unit the product is sold at. May be undefined.
-   `quantity`: quantity the product is sold at for the given price
-   `bio`: whether this product is classified as organic/"Bio"

The project consists of a trivial NodeJS Express server responsible for fetching the product data, massaging it, and serving it to the front end (see `index.js`). The front end is a least-effort vanilla HTML/JS search form (see sources in `site/`).

## Run via NodeJS

Install NodeJS, then run this in a shell of your choice.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/badlogic/heissepreise
cd heissepreise
npm install
node index.js
```

The first time you run this, the data needs to be fetched from the stores. You should see log out put like this.

```bash

Example app listening on port 3000
```

Once the app is listening per default on port 3000, open <http://localhost:3000> in your browser.\
**Note**: If you want to start on a different port add it as the third parameter, e.g. `node index.js 3001` will map to port `3001`.

Subsequent starts will fetch the data asynchronously, so you can start working immediately.

## Run via GitHub pages & GitHub workflows

Create a GitHub account and pick a username. Below, we assume your user name is `hotprices123`. **Replace `hotprices123` with your real username everywhere you see it below**

1. Log in to your GitHub account.
2. [Fork](https://github.com/badlogic/heissepreise/fork) this repository and name the repository `hotprices123.github.io`.
3. **In your forked repository**:
    1. go to `Settings > Pages`, then under `Branch` select the `main` branch, and the `docs/` directory as shown in this screenshot.
       ![site/img/github-pages.png](site/img/github-pages.png)
    2. go to `Settings > Actions > General`, then under `Workflow permissions`, select `Read and write permissions` as shown in this screenshot.
       ![site/img/github-permissions.png](site/img/github-permissions.png)
    3. go to the `Actions` tab, then select the `Pages Update` workflow in the list to the left, then click `Enable workflow`. Confirm that you know what you are doing.

5. Once the workflow has finished, go to `https:/hotprices123.github.io` and enjoy your price comparisons.

The data will be automatically fetched once a day at 8am (no idea what timezone), and the site will be updated.

To get the latest code changes from this repository into your fork:

1. Go to `https://github.com/hotprices123/hotprices123.github.io/compare/main...badlogic:heissepreise:main`
2. Click on `Create pull request`
   ![site/img/github-pullrequest.png](site/img/github-pullrequest.png)
3. Enter a Title like "Updated from upstream", then click `Create pull request``

4. Click `Merge pull request`
   ![site/img/github-pullrequest3.png](site/img/github-pullrequest3.png)

Your site will now use the latest source code changes from this repository. It will be automatically updated and is usually live under `https://hotprices123.github.io` within 10-15 minutes.

## Docker

The project has a somewhat peculiar Docker Compose setup in `docker/` tailored to my infrastructure. You can entirely ignore it.
